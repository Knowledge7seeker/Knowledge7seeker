# 👨‍💻 Estifanos' GitHub Persona  

Welcome to my GitHub! 🚀 I’m Estifanos, an **AI researcher**, **junior software engineer**, and lifelong learner passionate about pushing the boundaries of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, and **unsupervised learning**.  

## 🌟 About Me  

- 🎓 **IT Graduate** turned **NLP Researcher** focused on **Question Generation**, **Knowledge Inquiry**, and **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)**, particularly in **Amharic**.  
- 📚 Currently exploring **Graph-based Knowledge Encoding** for **NLP systems** and applying **continuous learning** methods to solve real-world problems.  
- 🤖 Building a **Telegram bot** to gather quality Amharic question-answer data and exploring innovative ways to structure **follow-up questions** for **healthcare and education**.  
- 🧠 Interested in creating AI systems that demonstrate **emotional intelligence** and solve problems beyond predefined rules.  

## 💻 Tech Stack  

- **Programming Languages**: Python 🐍 | JavaScript ✨  
- **Frameworks & Tools**: PyTorch 🔥 | TensorFlow 🤖 | Hugging Face 🤗  
- **Databases**: MongoDB 🍃 | PostgreSQL 🐘  
- **Other Skills**: pandas 🐼 | Jupyter Notebooks 📓 | Git & GitHub 🌐  

## 🚧 Projects in Focus  

1. **MLMQG: Masked Language Model for Question Generation**  
   - 🌱 Training models to generate questions iteratively using masked word prediction.  
   - 📊 Evaluation: Using metrics like **BLEU score** and improving question quality over iterations.  

2. **Amharic SRL System**  
   - 🗂️ Leveraging multilingual models to predict semantic roles for Amharic datasets.  

3. **Graph-based Question Generation**  
   - 🔗 Developing unsupervised graph representations to encode knowledge for **follow-up question generation**.  

4. **Telegram Bot for QA Data Collection**  
   - 🤝 Incentivizing users to generate Amharic question-answer data with pre-testing and quality metrics.  

## 📈 Key Interests  

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Building systems that adapt and learn autonomously.  
- **Emotional Intelligence in AI**: Crafting systems that respond with human-like empathy.  

## 🔗 Connect  

- 💬 Let's collaborate on **NLP, AI, or GNN** projects!  
- 🌟 I’m always open to **feedback** and learning from the community.
